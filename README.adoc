== Introduction
The goal of project is to provide a set of tools that will ease the development process for build systems code written
in `CMake`. Main ideas of the tool are but not limited to:

- `CMake` code formatting - based on language syntax analysis
- modern `CMake` static analysis - basic code analysis with possible auto-fixing.
- large flexibility of configuration - as coding styles differ quite a lot.
- easy to use - mimic usage and parameters with other state-of-the-art tools to reduce learning curve for users.
